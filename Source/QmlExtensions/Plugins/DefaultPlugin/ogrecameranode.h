	/*!  This function configures the camera auto-tracking feature that automatically tracks a scene node in the 3D scene.
	 * @remarks
	 * If you enable auto-tracking, this Camera will automatically rotate to look at the target SceneNode every frame, 
	 * no matter how it or SceneNode move. This is handy if you want a Camera to be focused on a single object or group of objects. 
	 * Note that by default the Camera looks at the origin of the SceneNode, if you want to tweak this, e.g. if the object which is
	 * attached to this target node is quite big and you want to point the camera at a specific point on it, provide a vector in the 
	 * 'offset' parameter and the camera's target point will be adjusted.
	 * @param bEnable a boolean value determining whether the auto-tracking feature should be enabled. 
	 * If false the camera will cease tracking and will remain in it's current orientation.
	 * @param sSceneNodeName a string containing name of the scene node to track
	 * @param vecOffset a QVector3D structure (optional, default = QVector3D(0.0,0.0,0.0)) containing 
	 * a point the camera targets in local space of the scene node (instead of the origin of the scene node). Good for fine tuning the look at point.
	 * @return a boolean value determining whether the function executed successfully.
