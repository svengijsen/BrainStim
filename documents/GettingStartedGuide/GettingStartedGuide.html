                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this document is to show you the basic features of BrainStim in a tutorial way.
                    The best way working through this document is starting from the beginning and follow all tutorials
                    till the end of the document, you could also only follow a single specific 
					<span lang="en-us">topic</span> of your interest but then please bear
                    in mind that some <span lang="en-us">topics</span> e<span lang="en-us">x</span>pect you to already 
					<span lang="en-us">have</span> some knowledge of previous t<span lang="en-us">opics</span>.<span lang="en-us"> 
					This Getting Started guide mainly covers the basic usage of 
					BrainStim and it's features, most user plan to use BrainStim 
					for creating and running their behavioral, psychological and 
					physiological experiments but because these features are 
					beyond the basic BrainStim features these are described in 
					the <a href="../ExperimentManagerPlugin/CreatingExperiments.html">Creating Experiments with the Experiment Manager guide</a>. 
					Please be aware that this guide may exspect you to read the 
					below <em>Getting Started Guide</em> first.</span><br />
					This Getting started guide is
                    not perfect and continuously under construction, so we would be happy to receive feedback about bugs, typos, comments,
                    new ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>Installation</h2>
                <p>
                    Installing BrainStim on your computer is easy, you can download the latest release from the <a href="http://github.com/svengijsen/BrainStim/releases" target="_blank">GitHub project site</a>. The <a href="http://github.com/svengijsen/BrainStim" target="_blank">public BrainStim source code repository</a> is also hosted here.
                    You can choose between a 32 and 64-bit version of BrainStim depending on <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/21726/how-do-i-know-if-im-running-32-bit-or-64-bit-windows-answers/" target="_blank">the Windows operating system type</a> you're using.
                    You can use the previous link as a guidance for checking this configuration or alternatively you can execute the following Command Prompt command (a Command prompt can be opened using the: <kbd>Windows start button</kbd> --&gt; <kbd>Run...</kbd> --&gt; enter the text <kbd>cmd</kbd> --&gt; hit the <kbd>enter</kbd> key):
				</p>                    
                <table class="codeframe">
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-bsh">echo %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE% </code></pre>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <p>If it echoes with <em>x86</em> then you're working on a 32-bit architecture, if not then it's an  64-bit architecture.</p>
                <p>
                BrainStim strongly depends on the <a href="http://www.opengl.org/" target="_blank">OpenGL 2.0 (or higher) graphics library</a>, so for an optimal usage please make sure that your graphics card supports OpenGL 2.0 (or higher) and that the drivers for this graphics card are up to date.
                When installing BrainStim you should try to do this using administrator privileges. There are also some virus scanners which trigger a false virus detection due to the automatic installation of various (network) libraries. If you should receive a detection message like this, you could consider deactivating the real-time virus detection while installing BrainStim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The BrainStim release download is compressed inside a zip file and should first be extracted, after that you can execute the BrainStim installer (preferable using administrative privileges).
                </p>
                <h3>BrainStim Directories</h3>
                <h4 id="MainProgramdirectory">Main Program directory</h4>
                <p>
                    The BrainStim installer copies the program files to the default <strong>Main Program directory</strong> (default: <em>C:\Program Files (x86)\BrainStim</em>), during installation the location for this directory can be customized.
                    Inside this directory you can find the BrainStim.exe executable file that you can use to execute the  BrainStim program. Some sub-directories found in this directory are:
                </p>

				    </tr>
				  </tbody>
				</table>
    

				<p>BrainStim makes use of two additional directories, these directories are created and used after the first start of BrainStim, these are:</p>

                <h4>Main User directory</h4>
                <p>
                    Depending on the windows login username and BrainStim version the path is:
                </p>
                <p><strong>C:\Users\<em>&lt;login username&gt;</em>\BrainStim(<em>vx.x.x.x, xx-bits</em>)</strong></p>
                <p>
                    This directory is mainly used for user specific
                    dynamic  data access(read/write) and is empty (or perhaps not present) before the first start of BrainStim.

                    Inside this directory you can find the following sub-directories/files:
                </p>

                <h3>Exercises - Editing</h3>
                <h4>The BrainStim User Interface</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>We can see that BrainStim automatically adds a line number in front of the text lines. In the right lower corner we can also see the total number of lines and some information about the cursor position inside the document.</li>
                    <li>It's possible to open and edit multiple files 
					simultaneously, let's try this by opening another file, open 
					the file (&lt;BrainStim directory&gt;\Examples\BrainStim\QtScript 
					UserInterfaces\AnalogClock.qs) by using the shortcut key combination <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd> and then browsing and selecting the file.</li>
                    <li>This file has the extension (*.qs) and is known and detected  as a BrainStim script file. Although the document contains no text styling formatting information (only textual), the document is shown in the new document with a special styling formatting. This is automatically done by the internal document editor because it already knows how to handle this type of file. </li>
                    <li>If we open the <em>Window</em> menu we can see the two opened documents, you can switch between them pressing the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>TAB</kbd> shortcut key combination or maybe by selecting one from the <em>Window</em> menu. Furthermore if you choose the <em>Tile</em> option the two documents are automatically tiled, alternatively you can move and resize them.</li>
                    <li>Recently opened documents (the last 8 previously opened document(s)) can be quickly reopened using the <em>File</em> menu and then selecting the appropriate document, try this after having closed the opened documents.</li>
                    <li>Standard <em>Find</em> and <em>Replace</em> options  are  available from the <em>Edit</em> menu. Maybe you want to try these options to find out how they work.</li>
                    <li>The <em>Markers</em> menu contains several commands for accessing  the markers features used for quick navigation inside a document. After you have opened a document you can click with your mouse on a line number of a document to create or remove a marker or alternatively use the <em>Add/Remove marker</em> command from the <em>Markers</em> menu. Make the cursor jump to a specific marker by using the <em>next/previous marker</em> commands. Try the <em>Markers</em> menu commands to find out about how to use the quick navigation marker features. </li>
                    <li>The <em>Document</em> menu contains commands for handling the execution of documents by an internal  engine, this is explained later.</li>
                    <li>The <em>Tools</em> menu contains commands for the configuration of BrainStim.</li>
                    <li>The <em>Help</em> menu contains commands for accessing all kind of versioning information about BrainStim and it's loaded plug-ins. Another important feature is the <em>Help Contents</em> command (or use the F1 key) that opens a viewer for the BrainStim Help collection. This Help collection contains extensive information about BrainStim, the available plug-ins, a complete script reference and off course this Getting started guide.</li>
                    <li>Another UI component is the <em>Output Log</em> pane  on default in the lower part (you can move and resize this pane) of the BrainStim window. We'll see that this  <em>Output Log</em> pane is very useful for testing and debugging scripts. Some commands for for this pane are available if you right-click with your mouse onto it or by opening the <em>Edit</em> --&gt; <em>Output Log Pane</em> menu.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Exercises - Scripting</h3>
                <p>Although the below scripting exercises a pretty easy to understand for a general programmer, they do expect you to have already gained some knowledge about scripting and basic programming. </p>
                <h4>Hello World script</h4>
                <p>Let's first try to open/view and execute a very basic script with BrainStim</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start BrainStim</li>
                    <li>Open the file (<em>File -&gt; Open</em>... or use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd> key combination) <em>HelloWorld.qs </em>found in the directory <em>BrainStim\examples\GettingStartedGuide\BasicScripting\</em>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can see again that the plain text is automatically highlighted/styled according to the syntax it contains. Text/code can be commented using the single line comment <em>?//?</em> or the multi-line <em>?/*?</em> and <em>?*/?</em> combination, commented text is not executed by the internal script engine but can be  used for the documentation of script code for a better understanding. In the script three variables are declared (using the <em>var </em>statement) and a value is assigned to them,  the third variable  is assigned to the calculated sum  of the first two variables. The value of this third variable is then used in a special function called <em>Log()</em> that  appends the provided string parameter to the BrainStim Output Log pane. To clear the Output Log pane right-click on it and select <em>Clear All Output Item(s)</em>. Some times you might want to copy some text  from the output log pane, you can do this by selecting the text to copy  to the clipboard and then right-click on it and select <em>Copy Selected Text</em>. Alternatively you can also use the default operating systems Copy/Paste commands.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Execute the QtScript code (done by the internal BrainStim script engine) by using the <kbd>F5</kbd> key or by the menu  <em>Document -&gt; Execute</em> command.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The QtScript code of the current active document is then evaluated and executed. You can see  in the Output Log pane when the script started/stopped evaluation and how many time it took to evaluate. We can also see that for each <em>Log()</em> function call there's one  additional line appended to the Log Output pane.</p>
                <h4>Functions and includes</h4>
                <p>Within the BrainStim script (QtScript) you can define functions and includes that allow you to structure this script in a more modular way

                <h4>Additional BrainStim Functions</h4>
                <p>In a previous exercise we already made use of the additional <em>Log()</em> function to write text to the log output pane which can be very useful for debugging purpose. This  <em>Log()</em> function is made available in the script environment by the BrainStim application to provide a convenient way for the user to easily output  information from the running script to the main BrainStim User Interface. There are more additional convenient functions made available to the script environment by the BrainStim application, as you can see in the following example. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start BrainStim.</li>
                    <li>Open the file <em>AdditionalBrainStimFunctions.qs </em>found in the directory <em>BrainStim\examples\GettingStartedGuide\BasicScripting\</em>.</li>
                    <li>Execute the QtScript code.</li>
                    <li>Take a look at the script and make sure that it makes sense to you.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When we look at the script code we see that it uses some additional functions prepended with the ?<em>BrainStim</em>? namespace (followed/separated by a dot) because these used functions belong to the BrainStim main program. We see some functions that can retrieve absolute directory paths, environment information etc, but also some functions that perform BrainStim UI functionality like <em>find()</em> and<em> closeSelectedScriptFile()</em>. All available additional BrainStim script functions are described in the  <a href="../../References/Script/BrainStimMainApp/Doxygen/class_main_window.html">BrainStim Main Application Scripting Reference</a>. <br />
                    The <em>Log()</em> function is actually the same as the  <em>BrainStim.write2OutputWindow()</em> function (internally it does exactly the same) but because this functionality it's so commonly used and the <em>BrainStim.write2OutputWindow()</em> function takes a lot of characters(key presses) and time to code that it has been made available to the script engine under the short <em>Log()</em> function signature.
                </p>
                <h4>Dynamic Object construction and Garbage Collection</h4>
                <p>The internal BrainStim script engine uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)" target="_blank">garbage collection</a> method to reclaim memory used by the script objects when they are no longer needed. 
				<span lang="en-us">Because this is important it's a good 
				programming pratice to follow some guidelines to make sure this 
				can happen, read <a href="../BrainStim/GarbageCollection.html">

                <h4>Qt Library Script Bindings</h4>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;To further extend the script engine functionality BrainStim 
					has a feature that automatically detects and integrates 
					(pre-generated) Qt bindings for the Qt Script environment. 
					With these bindings you get access to substantial portions 
					of the Qt API from within Qt Script. <span lang="en-us">Read
					<a href="../BrainStim/QtLibraryScriptBindings.html">this 
					document</a> for more information about this topic.</span></p>
                <h4>The Signal/Slots mechanism</h4>
                <p>The BrainStim script engine  supports  <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtcore/signalsandslots.html" target="_blank">Qt-style signal and slot<span lang="en-us">
				</span>connections</a>, that can make the script very 
				<span lang="en-us">powerfull, see

                <h4>BrainStim Plug-in Script Bindings</h4>
                <p>BrainStim has the ability to automatically integrate (load and embed) plug-ins that extend the functionality  of BrainStim (see the <a href="../../References/Plugins/PluginReference.html">plug-in reference</a> for a list of available plug-ins). These plug-ins can  expose their functionality to the BrainStim Script engine, allowing the user to take advantage of these plug-ins  inside the script context. Usually this is done by constructing a object dynamically inside the script from the exposed plug-in script class which we can then make use of. Each plug-in has the possibility to implement its own custom  User Interface that can be opened from BrainStim, normally this User Interface offers a user friendly way  for  accessing and testing the plug-ins functionality. For a c++ programmer it's not difficult to create a new custom BrainStim plug-in to extend the program (if you are interested in this please contact us at sven dot gijsen at maastrichtuniversity dot nl).</p>
                <p><u>Important</u>: The internal plug-in object, used by the plug-ins User Interface to show its functionality, is in no way connected to the script or any script object created from this plug-ins class! This is because that internal plug-in is only used for testing purpose and easy access it's features but not for a global configuration. Objects that are dynamically created inside the script context from the plug-ins script class are new instances and in no way connected to the plug-ins UI.</p>
                <p> BrainStim has totally no knowledge of the internal plug-ins implementation and does not define  what or how they should do things, making this plug-in framework  very flexible for developers. A BrainStim installation contains some standard plug-ins that are automatically installed together with BrainStim. These can be installed as a separate plug-in file or build inside the BrainStim executable (these plug-ins are called <em>static</em>).  Plug-ins are grouped in either <em>Device </em>or <em>Extension </em>plug-ins. As we already know by now a plug-in can define a custom (script) class from which we can construct new script plug-in objects. Let's first take a look at a plug-ins implemented UI and some of its features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start BrainStim.</li>
                    <li>Make sure that the<em> </em>BrainStim plug-in named <em>KeyBoardPlugin </em>is available by opening the menu <em>Help -&gt; About BrainStim</em> command. Inside the plug-ins listbox you should see this plug-in listed. It's marked as  <em>Static</em> which means that this plug-in is build into the BrainStim executable and therefore is always available for usage. <em>Dynamic</em> plug-ins are automatically loaded  and embedded  at the startup of BrainStim.  </li>
                    <li>Open the <em>KeyBoardPlugin</em> User Interface by opening the menu <em>Plugins -&gt; Device Plugins -&gt; KeyBoardDevice Plugin</em>.</li>
                    <li>This plug-in is capable of capturing key presses/releases, you can try this by clicking on the <em>Start Capture Thread</em> button and press some keys. Play around with the plug-ins dialog features to get an understanding of what the plug-in can do.</li>
                    <li>Click on the <em>Stop  Capture Thread</em> button and Close the plug-ins UI dialog.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We can also construct a new plug-in object from this plug-ins script class, lets try this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open the file <em>BrainStimPluginScriptBindings.qs </em>found in the directory <em>BrainStim\examples\GettingStartedGuide\BasicScripting\</em>.</li>
                    <li>Examine the script quickly and then execute the QtScript code.</li>
                    <li>Repeat pressing a keyboard key (i.e. key <em>'4') </em> until the script finishes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We saw that the key codes (a unique number for each key) of the captured key presses where logged to the Output Log Pane and after having pressed 4 times the script automatically ended. The line <em>var KeyBoardCaptureObj = new KeyBoardCapture(); </em>constructs a new  object from the class defined by the KeyBoardCapture plug-in. This object is then used by the script. We now need to know what this plug-in object can do:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open the <em>Help Contents</em> by pressing the <em>'F1'</em> key.</li>
                    <li>Enter '<em>KeyBoardCapture</em>' in the help search field and press enter. A help document with the name <em>KeyBoard Device script class</em> is found let's open that by clicking on the link. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This help document is a script class reference, that shows all the available signals/slots and member function that can be used inside the script context for this plug-ins script class.  </p>
                <h2>The Experiment Manager plug-in</h2>
                <p>We saw that BrainStim is a rich multiple document editor with an internal script engine that can execute scripts and that it can be extended by the use of custom  plug-ins. However, the  main goal during  development  was to create a platform for editing and executing behavioural experiments for supporting cognitive research. Creating behavioural experiments can be done by using solely the BrainStim script engine but this is pretty difficult for an average user. Therefore a BrainStim plug-in called the <em>Experiment Manager</em> 
				was created to support more functionality for creating and 
				running behavioural experiments. <strong>Important!</strong> 
				It's advised to read the document
				<a href="../ExperimentManagerPlugin/CreatingExperiments.html">
				Creating Experiments with the Experiment Manager</a> to get 
				started!</p>
                <h2>How to proceed...</h2>
                <p>Due to the huge capabilities of BrainStim this Getting Started guide might be 
				somehow difficult to fully understand immediately, this is not a  
				real problem. It's important to gain a general idea of how BrainStim works and  what it's main capabilities are. If you then want to give it a try you could then start by 
				changing an example from this Getting Started Guide or proceed 
				with one of the 
				<a href="../Examples/AdvancedExamples.html" target="_blank">Advanced 
				Examples</a> found in the <em>&lt;BrainStim Installation Directory&gt;\examples\BrainStim\Advanced\</em> directory.

				maastrichtuniversity dot nl for feedback and questions!</p>
