    <h2>
        Introduction</h2>
        
                <p>The default BrainStim User-interface contains a <em>MenuBar</em>, 
				<em>ToolBar</em>, <em>Document Editing</em>, <em>OutputLog</em> and a
				<em>StatusBar</em> region:<br />
				<br />
		</p>
				<p><img src="./../../images/userinterface.png" class="img-responsive centered" alt="" /></p>
                <h2 id="Usercustomizations">User customizations</h2>
		<p>The User-Interface can be customized by the user, customizations can 
		be resizing, repositioning and hiding/showing elements. All 
		customizations are 
		automatically saved for each <a href="DocumentTypes.html">document type</a> 
		to the <a href="../GettingStartedGuide/GettingStartedGuide.html#BrainStimSettingsfile">
		Settings file</a> seperately 
		and reloaded/applied when a document of that type is opened/activated.</p>
		<h3>Dockable windows</h3>
		<p>BrainStim can contain one or more dockable windows, like the 
		<em>OutputLog</em>, that can be resized and moved around. You can resize these 
		dockable windows by hovering your mouse over the borders of that window 
		(the mouse icon changes) and then by using your left mouse button 
		together with some movements (drag) to fit its size to your needs. You can even
		drag the dockable window so that it becomes a 
		free floating window, you can do this by left mouse click and hold the 
		docable window header title (like the '<em>Output Log</em>' header title) and move it to somewere else and then release 
		your left mouse button again. You might have notice while moving around 
		the window that you can also move it to some predefined locations inside 
		the Brainstim main window. These dockable areas are located around the 
		left, top, right and bottom border of the <em>Document Editing region</em>. 
		Furthermore it's even posible to completely hide a dockable window 
		byusing your mouse and right click it's header and then uncheck it. 
		<strong>Important!</strong> 
		to show a dockable window again you can use your mouse and right click 
		on the <strong>ToolBar</strong> and then check the dockable window from 
		the list that appears again.<br />
		(Custom) Plugins may also implement additional dockable windows<span lang="nl">,

				    </tr>
				    <tr>
				      <th scope="row">Document</th>
				      <td>contains commands for controlling the execution of various documents like script (<em>*.qs</em>) files.</td>
				    </tr>
				    <tr>
				      <th scope="row">Tools</th>
				      <td>contains an option command that lets you configure the BrainStim settings.</td>
				    </tr>
				    <tr>
				      <th scope="row">Plugins</th>
				      <td>contains commands for the loaded/embedded plug-ins in BrainStim. With these commands you can open the plug-in's  User Interface. Plug-ins are automatic divided in <em>Extension</em> and <em>Device</em> plug-ins. You can also open the Plugin Managers dialog from this menu.</td>
				    </tr>
				    <tr>
				      <th scope="row">Help</th>
				      <td>contains commands for opening the  BrainStim help and viewing release information about  BrainStim.</td>

				</table>
				<p>The<span lang="nl"> default menu bar can be extended by 
				implementing one or more menu configuration files, read
				<a href="CustomMenus.html">this document</a> for 
				more infomation about this topic.</span></p>
		<h2>File/document handling</h2>
		<p>BrainStim can open and edit type of files, see
		<a href="DocumentTypes.html">this document</a> for more information 
		about this topic. To open a file in BrainStim you can simply drag/drop 
		the file from a Windows File Explorer to the <em>Document Editing Region</em>, 
		or use the menu entry <kbd>File</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Open...</kbd> (<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd> 
		key combination) and then select the file(s) you wish to open. The last 10 
		opened file(s) are also listed in the <kbd>File</kbd> menu and can be 
		easily re-opened by using one of these menu entries. Saving a file can 
		be performed by using the menu entry <kbd>File</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Save...</kbd> (<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>
		s</kbd> key combination) if no file path has yet been set then you'll be 
		asked to do so. If you try close a file that has been changed then 
		you're also automatically asked if it should be saved first. Creating a 
		new file can be done using the menu entry <kbd>File</kbd> &gt; <kbd>New...</kbd> 
		and then choosing a specific file type. BrainStim automatically detects 
		the file type and optimizes the User-Interface suit the editing of this 
		file type, read <a href="DocumentTypes.html">this document</a> for more 
		information about this topic.</p>
		<h3>Document windows</h3>
		<p>BrainStim is a multiple document editor, meaning that it can open and 
		edit multiple (different) files simultaneously in seperate documents. 
		Each document has it's own <em>Document Editing</em> window and they can 
		be activated by selecting them using the tabular bar right above the <em>
		Document Editing</em> region. You can also swith between them using the
		<kbd>Window</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Next</kbd> or <kbd>Window</kbd> &gt; <kbd>
		Previous</kbd> menu entry, or by selecting one of them from the list of 
		opened documents inside the <kbd>Window</kbd> menu. After you activate 
		(or open) a new document BrainStim will automatically adapt it's 
		User-Interface to that document type, read <a href="DocumentTypes.html">
		this document</a> for more information about this topic.</p>
		<h3>Code editing</h3>
		<p>BrainStim makes use of a internal<em> Code editor</em> for the 
		editing of document types that are text-based (that could be some kind of 
		source code), like the QtScript file (*.qs) document type. Depending on the file 
		type this code editor is automatically customized to support that type 
		of file type editing. Some features are by default implemented like:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Automatic <span class="auto-style1">line numbering</span> in 
			front of each line.</li>
			<li>Showing some information about the file and the position of the 
			cursor in <em>StatusBar</em>.</li>
			<li>Enabling the use of <span class="auto-style1">markers</span>, 
			see below.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Markers</h4>
		<p>Inside the internal <em>Code Editor</em> you can add/remove markers 
		by clicking the line number to toggle it on/off. You can also do this 
		using the menu entry <kbd>Markers</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Add/Remove marker</kbd> (<kbd>F2</kbd> 
		key). After adding a marker you can see a small triangular item in front 
		of the current line number and a new entry in the list of current 
		markers in the <kbd>Markers</kbd> menu. If you select such an entry then 
		the cursor will automatically jump to the position of that marker which 
		makes it easy to jump from one stored location in a document to another 
		instead of scrolling and searching through the documents content. 
		Furthermore the menu entries <kbd>Markers</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Next marker</kbd> (<kbd>F4</kbd> 
		key) and <kbd>Markers</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Previous marker</kbd> (<kbd>F6</kbd> 
		key) are ideal for switching quickly back and forth through the custom 
		added markers.</p>
		<h2 id="OutputLogwindow">Output Log window</h2>
		<p>The <em>Output Log window</em> is by default visible and located in the lower 
		part of the BrainStim User-Interface, this can be customized (see the
		<a href="#Usercustomizations">User customizations</a> chapter above for 
		more information about this topic). The <em>Output Log window</em> can 
		contain multiple sub-windows that can be selected individually by the 
		use of a tabular selection bar. By default there's only one sub-window 
		available under the name '<em>Default</em>'. Read
		<a href="ScriptDebugging.html#UsingtheOutputLogwindow">this document</a> 
		for more information about how to control this Output Log window from a 
		script. The menu&nbsp; <kbd>Edit</kbd> &gt; 
			<kbd>Output Log</kbd> contains several commans for working with the <em>Output Log window</em>, 
		alternatively you can right click with you mouse in a sub-window to show 
		a menu of commands.</p>
