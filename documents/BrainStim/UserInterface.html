    <h2>
        Introduction</h2>
        
                <p>The default BrainStim User-interface contains a <em>MenuBar</em>, 
				<em>ToolBar</em>, <em>Document Editing</em>, <em>OutputLog</em> and a
				<em>StatusBar</em> region:<br />
				<br />
		</p>
				<p><img src="./../../images/userinterface.png" class="img-responsive" alt="" /></p>
                <h2 id="Usercustomizations">User customizations</h2>
		<p>The User-Interface can be customized by the user, customizations can 
		be resizing, repositioning and hiding/showing elements. All 
		customizations are 
		automatically saved for each <a href="DocumentTypes.html">document type</a> 
		to the <a href="../GettingStartedGuide/GettingStartedGuide.html#BrainStimSettingsfile">
		Settings file</a> seperately 
		and reloaded/applied when a document of that type is opened/activated.</p>
		<h3>Dockable windows</h3>
		<p>BrainStim can contain one or more dockable windows, like the 
		<em>OutputLog</em>, that can be resized and moved around. You can resize these 
		dockable windows by hovering your mouse over the borders of that window 
		(the mouse icon changes) and then by using your left mouse button 
		together with some movements (drag) to fit its size to your needs. You can even
		drag the dockable window so that it becomes a 
		free floating window, you can do this by left mouse click and hold the 
		docable window header title (like the '<em>Output Log</em>' header title) and move it to somewere else and then release 
		your left mouse button again. You might have notice while moving around 
		the window that you can also move it to some predefined locations inside 
		the Brainstim main window. These dockable areas are located around the 
		left, top, right and bottom border of the <em>Document Editing region</em>. 
		Furthermore it's even posible to completely hide a dockable window 
		byusing your mouse and right click it's header and then uncheck it. 
		<strong>Important!</strong> 
		to show a dockable window again you can use your mouse and right click 
		on the <strong>ToolBar</strong> and then check the dockable window from 
		the list that appears again.<br />
		(Custom) Plugins may also implement additional dockable windows<span lang="nl">, 
				read <a href="../BrainStim/DocumentTypes.html">this document</a>

				</table>
				<p>The<span lang="nl"> default menu bar can be extended by 
				implementing one or more menu configuration files, read
				<a href="CustomMenus.html">this document</a> for 
				more infomation about this topic.</span></p>
		<h2>File/document handling</h2>
		<p>BrainStim can open and edit type of files, see
		<a href="DocumentTypes.html">this document</a> for more information 
		about this topic. To open a file in BrainStim you can simply drag/drop 
		the file from a Windows File Explorer to the <em>Document Editing Region</em>, 
		or use the menu entry <kbd>File</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Open...</kbd> (<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd> 
		key combination) and then select the file(s) you wish to open. The last 10 
		opened file(s) are also listed in the <kbd>File</kbd> menu and can be 
		easily re-opened by using one of these menu entries. Saving a file can 
		be performed by using the menu entry <kbd>File</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Save...</kbd> (<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>
		s</kbd> key combination) if no file path has yet been set then you'll be 
		asked to do so. If you try close a file that has been changed then 
		you're also automatically asked if it should be saved first. Creating a 
		new file can be done using the menu entry <kbd>File</kbd> &gt; <kbd>New...</kbd> 
		and then choosing a specific file type. BrainStim automatically detects 
		the file type and optimizes the User-Interface suit the editing of this 
		file type, read <a href="DocumentTypes.html">this document</a> for more 
		information about this topic.</p>
		<h3>Document windows</h3>
		<p>BrainStim is a multiple document editor, meaning that it can open and 
		edit multiple (different) files simultaneously in seperate documents. 
		Each document has it's own <em>Document Editing</em> window and they can 
		be activated by selecting them using the tabular bar right above the <em>
		Document Editing</em> region. You can also swith between them using the
		<kbd>Window</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Next</kbd> or <kbd>Window</kbd> &gt; <kbd>
		Previous</kbd> menu entry, or by selecting one of them from the list of 
		opened documents inside the <kbd>Window</kbd> menu. After you activate 
		(or open) a new document BrainStim will automatically adapt it's 
		User-Interface to that document type, read <a href="DocumentTypes.html">
		this document</a> for more information about this topic.</p>
		<h3>Code editing</h3>
		<p>BrainStim makes use of a internal<em> Code editor</em> for the 
		editing of document types that are text-based (that could be some kind of 
		source code), like the QtScript file (*.qs) document type. Depending on the file 
		type this code editor is automatically customized to support that type 
		of file type editing. Some features are by default implemented like:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Automatic <span class="auto-style1">line numbering</span> in 
			front of each line.</li>
			<li>Showing some information about the file and the position of the 
			cursor in <em>StatusBar</em>.</li>
			<li>Enabling the use of <span class="auto-style1">markers</span>, 
			see below.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Markers</h2>
		<p>Inside the internal <em>Code Editor</em> you can add/remove markers 
		by clicking the line number to toggle it on/off. You can also do this 
		using the menu entry <kbd>Markers</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Add/Remove marker</kbd> (<kbd>F2</kbd> 
		key). After adding a marker you can see a small triangular item in front 
		of the current line number and a new entry in the list of current 
		markers in the <kbd>Markers</kbd> menu. If you select such an entry then 
		the cursor will automatically jump to the position of that marker which 
		makes it easy to jump from one stored location in a document to another 
		instead of scrolling and searching through the documents content. 
		Furthermore the menu entries <kbd>Markers</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Next marker</kbd> (<kbd>F4</kbd> 
		key) and <kbd>Markers</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Previous marker</kbd> (<kbd>F6</kbd> 
		key) are ideal for switching quickly back and forth through the custom 
		added markers.</p>
		<h2 id="OutputLogwindow">Output Log window</h2>
		<p>The <em>Output Log window</em> is by default visible and located in the lower 
		part of the BrainStim User-Interface, this can be customized (see the
		<a href="#Usercustomizations">User customizations</a> chapter above for 
		more information about this topic). The <em>Output Log window</em> can 
		contain multiple sub-windows that can be selected individually by the 
		use of a tabular selection bar. By default there's only one sub-window 
		available under the name '<em>Default</em>'. Read
		<a href="ScriptDebugging.html#UsingtheOutputLogwindow">this document</a> 
		for more information about how to control this Output Log window from a 
		script. The menu&nbsp; <kbd>Edit</kbd> &gt; 
			<kbd>Output Log</kbd> contains several commans for working with the <em>Output Log window</em>, 
		alternatively you can right click with you mouse in a sub-window to show 
		a menu of commands.</p>
		<h2>Executing a document</h2>
		<p>BrainStim has the ability to execute a document using the <kbd>F5</kbd> 
		key or the menu entry <kbd>Document</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Execute</kbd>. This 
		feature is not always available. Depending of the document type (by file 
		extension) and of if there's a execution routine implemented by 
		BrainStim or one of it's Plugins for that document type this option may 
		be available. If not then the <kbd>Execute</kbd> Menu entry and ToolBar 
		button are disabled. Read <a href="DocumentTypes.html">this document</a> 
		for more information about this topic. Sometimes it can happen that this&nbsp; <kbd>Execute</kbd> 
		button stays disabled after execution of your (QtScript *.qs) script 
		(although it seems that your script did what you expected it to do). You 
		cannot execute the script again because the&nbsp; <kbd>Execute</kbd> 
		button is disabled. When this happens you probaly didn't follow the 
		guidelines for a automatic garbage collection, read
		<a href="GarbageCollection.html">this document</a> for more information 
		about this topic. To enable the execute button again you can try to 
		abort the script first by using the <kbd>F7</kbd> 
		key or the menu entry <kbd>Document</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Abort</kbd>. If this 
		still doesn't work you can use the the <kbd>F9</kbd> 
		key or the menu entry <kbd>Document</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Restart Script 
		Engine</kbd> to completely restart the internal Script Engine.</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<p>There are several options available in BrainStim that let you 
		configure the program, you can read <a href="settingsDialog.html">this 
		document</a> for more information about this topic.</p>
		<h2>Plugins</h2>
		<p>BrainStim supports the use of plugins that can extend and make use of BrainStim features 
		using a Plugin Framework, read <a href="PluginFrameWork.html">this 
		document</a> for more information about this topic. </p>
		<p>A plugin can implement a custom dialog that is available by clicking 
		a menu entry inside the menu 
		<kbd>Plugins</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Extension Plugins</kbd> or 
		<kbd>Plugins</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Device Plugins</kbd>&nbsp; depending on the 
		type of the Plugin. This dialog together with it's underlying 
		functionality is completely implemented by the plugin itself. A standard 
		BrainStim installation contains some <em>default plugins</em> that are automatically 
		installed together with BrainStim, read <a href="DefaultPlugins.html">
		this document</a> for more information about these default plugins. </p>
		<h3>Plugin Manager</h3>
		<p>By using the menu entry <kbd>Plugins</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Plugin Manager</kbd> (or using the <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + 
		<kbd>p</kbd> key combination) you can open the Plugin Manager which 
		allows you to manage the current plugins or install (a) new plugin(s).</p>
		<p class="text-center">
		<img alt="" class="img-responsive" src="../../images/pluginmngr.png" /></p>
		<p>This dialog contains a hierarchical list that contains all the 
		detected plugin(s) during the startup of BrainStim. Each item can be 
		expanded for more detailed information about the plugin. The listed
		<span class="auto-style1">dynamic plugins</span> are actually files (dynamic libraries (*.dll)) 
		stored in the <em>Plugins</em> directory inside the
		<a href="../GettingStartedGuide/GettingStartedGuide.html#MainProgramdirectory">
		Main Program directory</a> except for those marked in the blue color and 
		the <em>(Static)</em> post-text, these are the so called
		<span class="auto-style1">static plugins</span>. These&nbsp; static 
		plugins are implemented inside the BrainStim executable. All Plug-ins are grouped in either 
		<strong>Device</strong> or <strong>Extension</strong> plugins. </p>
		<p>The below table explains where the buttons on the right part of the dialog can be used for:</p>

		<table class="table table-condensed">
		  <thead>
		    <tr>
		      <th><em>Button</em></th>
		      <th><em>Description</em></th>
		    </tr>

		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <th scope="row">Disable</th>
		      <td>This button allows you to disable a plugin that is selected in 
			  the list, BrainStim then automatically skippes the plugin from 
			  loading at startup. Newly installed plugins are automatically 
			  enabled. If they are manually disabled the text of the plugin in
