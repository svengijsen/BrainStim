    <h2>
        Introduction</h2>
        
                <p>The default BrainStim User-interface contains a <em>MenuBar</em>, 
				<em>ToolBar</em>, <em>Document Editing</em>, <em>OutputLog</em> and a
				<em>StatusBar</em> region:<br />
				<br />
		</p>
				<p><img src="./../../images/userinterface.png" class="img-responsive centered" alt="" /></p>
                <h2 id="Usercustomizations">User customizations</h2>
		<p>The User-Interface can be customized by the user, customizations can 
		be resizing, repositioning and hiding/showing elements. All 
		customizations are 
		automatically saved for each <a href="DocumentTypes.html">document type</a> 
		to the <a href="../GettingStartedGuide/GettingStartedGuide.html#BrainStimSettingsfile">
		Settings file</a> seperately 
		and reloaded/applied when a document of that type is opened/activated.</p>
		<h3>Dockable windows</h3>
		<p>BrainStim can contain one or more dockable windows, like the 
		<em>OutputLog</em>, that can be resized and moved around. You can resize these 
		dockable windows by hovering your mouse over the borders of that window 
		(the mouse icon changes) and then by using your left mouse button 
		together with some movements (drag) to fit its size to your needs. You can even
		drag the dockable window so that it becomes a 
		free floating window, you can do this by left mouse click and hold the 
		docable window header title (like the '<em>Output Log</em>' header title) and move it to somewere else and then release 
		your left mouse button again. You might have notice while moving around 
		the window that you can also move it to some predefined locations inside 
		the Brainstim main window. These dockable areas are located around the 
		left, top, right and bottom border of the <em>Document Editing region</em>. 
		Furthermore it's even posible to completely hide a dockable window 
		byusing your mouse and right click it's header and then uncheck it. 
		<strong>Important!</strong> 
		to show a dockable window again you can use your mouse and right click 
		on the <strong>ToolBar</strong> and then check the dockable window from 
		the list that appears again.<br />
		(Custom) Plugins may also implement additional dockable windows<span lang="nl">, 
				read <a href="../BrainStim/DocumentTypes.html">this document</a>

                <h2 id="MenuBar">Menu Bar</h2>
                <p>The <span lang="nl">default </span>menu bar includes the following menu's:</p>
				<table class="table table-condensed">
				  <thead>
				    <tr>
				      <th><em>File/Directory</em></th>

				    </tr>
				    <tr>
				      <th scope="row">Plugins</th>
				      <td>contains commands for the loaded/embedded plug-ins in BrainStim. With these commands you can open the plug-in's  User Interface. Plug-ins are automatic divided in <em>Extension</em> and <em>Device</em> plug-ins. You can also open the Plugin Managers dialog from this menu.</td>
				    </tr>
				    <tr>
				      <th scope="row">Help</th>
				      <td>contains commands for opening the  BrainStim help and viewing release information about  BrainStim.</td>
				    </tr>

				</table>
				<p>The<span lang="nl"> default menu bar can be extended by 
				implementing one or more menu configuration files, read
				<a href="CustomMenus.html">this document</a> for 
				more infomation about this topic.</span></p>
		<h2>File/document handling</h2>
		<p>BrainStim can open and edit type of files, see
		<a href="DocumentTypes.html">this document</a> for more information 
		about this topic. To open a file in BrainStim you can simply drag/drop 
		the file from a Windows File Explorer to the <em>Document Editing Region</em>, 
		or use the menu entry <kbd>File</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Open...</kbd> (<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd> 
		key combination) and then select the file(s) you wish to open. The last 10 
		opened file(s) are also listed in the <kbd>File</kbd> menu and can be 
		easily re-opened by using one of these menu entries. Saving a file can 
		be performed by using the menu entry <kbd>File</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Save...</kbd> (<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>
		s</kbd> key combination) if no file path has yet been set then you'll be 
		asked to do so. If you try close a file that has been changed then 
		you're also automatically asked if it should be saved first. Creating a 
		new file can be done using the menu entry <kbd>File</kbd> &gt; <kbd>New...</kbd> 
		and then choosing a specific file type. BrainStim automatically detects 
		the file type and optimizes the User-Interface suit the editing of this 
		file type, read <a href="DocumentTypes.html">this document</a> for more 
		information about this topic.</p>
		<h3>Document windows</h3>
		<p>BrainStim is a multiple document editor, meaning that it can open and 
		edit multiple (different) files simultaneously in seperate documents. 
		Each document has it's own <em>Document Editing</em> window and they can 
		be activated by selecting them using the tabular bar right above the <em>
		Document Editing</em> region. You can also swith between them using the
		<kbd>Window</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Next</kbd> or <kbd>Window</kbd> &gt; <kbd>
		Previous</kbd> menu entry, or by selecting one of them from the list of 
		opened documents inside the <kbd>Window</kbd> menu. After you activate 
		(or open) a new document BrainStim will automatically adapt it's 
		User-Interface to that document type, read <a href="DocumentTypes.html">
		this document</a> for more information about this topic.</p>
		<h3>Code editing</h3>
		<p>BrainStim makes use of a internal<em> Code editor</em> for the 
		editing of document types that are text-based (that could be some kind of 
		source code), like the QtScript file (*.qs) document type. Depending on the file 
		type this code editor is automatically customized to support that type 
		of file type editing. Some features are by default implemented like:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Automatic <span class="auto-style1">line numbering</span> in 
			front of each line.</li>
			<li>Showing some information about the file and the position of the 
			cursor in <em>StatusBar</em>.</li>
			<li>Enabling the use of <span class="auto-style1">markers</span>, 
			see below.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Markers</h2>
		<p>Inside the internal <em>Code Editor</em> you can add/remove markers 
		by clicking the line number to toggle it on/off. You can also do this 
		using the menu entry <kbd>Markers</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Add/Remove marker</kbd> (<kbd>F2</kbd> 
		key). After adding a marker you can see a small triangular item in front 
		of the current line number and a new entry in the list of current 
		markers in the <kbd>Markers</kbd> menu. If you select such an entry then 
		the cursor will automatically jump to the position of that marker which 
		makes it easy to jump from one stored location in a document to another 
		instead of scrolling and searching through the documents content. 
		Furthermore the menu entries <kbd>Markers</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Next marker</kbd> (<kbd>F4</kbd> 
		key) and <kbd>Markers</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Previous marker</kbd> (<kbd>F6</kbd> 
		key) are ideal for switching quickly back and forth through the custom 
		added markers.</p>
		<h2 id="OutputLogwindow">Output Log window</h2>
		<p>The <em>Output Log window</em> is by default visible and located in the lower 
		part of the BrainStim User-Interface, this can be customized (see the
		<a href="#Usercustomizations">User customizations</a> chapter above for 
		more information about this topic). The <em>Output Log window</em> can 
		contain multiple sub-windows that can be selected individually by the 
		use of a tabular selection bar. By default there's only one sub-window 
		available under the name '<em>Default</em>'. Read
		<a href="ScriptDebugging.html#UsingtheOutputLogwindow">this document</a> 
		for more information about how to control this Output Log window from a 
		script. The menu&nbsp; <kbd>Edit</kbd> &gt; 
			<kbd>Output Log</kbd> contains several commans for working with the <em>Output Log window</em>, 
		alternatively you can right click with you mouse in a sub-window to show 
		a menu of commands.</p>
		<h2>Executing a document</h2>
		<p>BrainStim has the ability to execute a document using the <kbd>F5</kbd> 
		key or the menu entry <kbd>Document</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Execute</kbd>. This 
		feature is not always available. Depending of the document type (by file 
		extension) and of if there's a execution routine implemented by 
		BrainStim or one of it's Plugins for that document type this option may 
		be available. If not then the <kbd>Execute</kbd> Menu entry and ToolBar 
		button are disabled. Read <a href="DocumentTypes.html">this document</a> 
		for more information about this topic. Sometimes it can happen that this&nbsp; <kbd>Execute</kbd> 
		button stays disabled after execution of your (QtScript *.qs) script 
		(although it seems that your script did what you expected it to do). You 
		cannot execute the script again because the&nbsp; <kbd>Execute</kbd> 
		button is disabled. When this happens you probaly didn't follow the 
		guidelines for a automatic garbage collection, read
		<a href="GarbageCollection.html">this document</a> for more information 
		about this topic. To enable the execute button again you can try to 
		abort the script first by using the <kbd>F7</kbd> 
		key or the menu entry <kbd>Document</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Abort</kbd>. If this 
		still doesn't work you can use the the <kbd>F9</kbd> 
		key or the menu entry <kbd>Document</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Restart Script 
		Engine</kbd> to completely restart the internal Script Engine.</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<p>There are several options available in BrainStim that let you 
		configure the program, you can read <a href="settingsDialog.html">this 
		document</a> for more information about this topic.</p>
		<h2>Plugins</h2>
		<p>BrainStim supports the use of plugins that can extend and make use of 
		BrainStim its features. It has an automatic plugin detecting and loading 
		functionality that can automatically integrate a plugin in the
		<span class="auto-style1">User Interface</span>,
		<span class="auto-style1">Script engine</span>,
		<span class="auto-style1">Option settings</span> and
		<span class="auto-style1">Help documentation</span>. Furthermore it's 
		even possible for a plugin to <span class="auto-style1">register one or 
		more specific file type(s) by extension</span> so it can implement the 
		loading, saving and execution of such document types,
		<a href="DocumentTypes.html">read this document</a> for more information 
		about this topic.</p>
		<p>A plugin can implement a custom dialog that is available by clicking 
		a menu entry inside the menu 
		<kbd>Plugins</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Extension Plugins</kbd> or 
		<kbd>Plugins</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Device Plugins</kbd>&nbsp; depending on the 
		type of the Plugin. This dialog together with it's underlying 
		functionality is completely implemented by the plugin itself. A standard 
		BrainStim installation contains some plugins that are automatically 
		installed together with BrainStim, read <a href="../defaultplugins.html">
		this document</a> for more information about this. </p>
		<h3>Plugin Manager</h3>
		<p>By using the menu entry <kbd>Plugins</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Plugin Manager</kbd> (or using the <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + 
		<kbd>p</kbd> key combination) you can open the Plugin Manager which 
		allows you to manage the current plugins or install (a) new plugin(s).</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>These default plugins can be implemented in dynamic library (*.dll) 
		stored somewhere in the <em>Plugins</em> directory inside the
		<a href="../GettingStartedGuide/GettingStartedGuide.html#MainProgramdirectory">
		Main Program directory</a>. the installed as a separate plug-in file or 
		build inside the BrainStim executable (these plug-ins are called 
		static). Plug-ins are grouped in either Device?or Extension?plug-ins. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;BrainStim sets no limitations to the plugin implementation nor 
		does it define what or how it should do things, 
		making this plug-in framework very flexible for developers. You can read
		<a href="../Development/Development.html">this document</a> for more 
		information about how you can start creating a custom BrainStim plugin.</p>
		<p>As we already know by now a plug-in can define a 
		custom (script) class from which we can construct new script plug-in 
		objects. Let's first take a look at a plug-ins implemented UI and some 
		of its features:</p>
		<p>This Plug that extend the functionality of BrainStim (see the plug-in 
		reference for a list of available plug-ins). These plug-ins can expose 
		their functionality to the BrainStim Script engine, allowing the user to 
		take advantage of these plug-ins inside the script context. Usually this 
		is done by constructing a object dynamically inside the script from the 
		exposed plug-in script class which we can then make use of. . For a c++ 
		programmer it's not difficult to create a new custom BrainStim plug-in 
		to extend the program (if you are interested in this please contact us 
		at sven dot gijsen at maastrichtuniversity dot nl).<br />
		<br />
		Important: The internal plug-in object, used by the plug-ins User 
		Interface to show its functionality, is in no way connected to the 
		script or any script object created from this plug-ins class! This is 
		because that internal plug-in is only used for testing purpose and easy 
		access it's features but not for a global configuration. Objects that 
		are dynamically created inside the script context from the plug-ins 
		script class are new instances and in no way connected to the plug-ins 
		UI.<br />
		<br />
		BrainStim has totally no knowledge of the internal plug-ins 
		implementation and does not define what or how they should do things, 
		making this plug-in framework very flexible for developers. A BrainStim 
		installation contains some standard plug-ins that are automatically 
		installed together with BrainStim. These can be installed as a separate 
		plug-in file or build inside the BrainStim executable (these plug-ins 
		are called static). Plug-ins are grouped in either Device?or 
		Extension?plug-ins. As we already know by now a plug-in can define a 
		custom (script) class from which we can construct new script plug-in 
		objects. Let's first take a look at a plug-ins implemented UI and some 
		of its features:<br />
		<br />
		Start BrainStim.<br />
		Make sure that the BrainStim plug-in named KeyBoardPlugin?is available 
		by opening the menu Help -&gt; About BrainStim command. Inside the plug-ins 
		listbox you should see this plug-in listed. It's marked as Static which 
		means that this plug-in is build into the BrainStim executable and 
		therefore is always available for usage. Dynamic plug-ins are 
		automatically loaded and embedded at the startup of BrainStim.<br />
		Open the KeyBoardPlugin User Interface by opening the menu Plugins -&gt; 
		Device Plugins -&gt; KeyBoardDevice Plugin.<br />
		This plug-in is capable of capturing key presses/releases, you can try 
		this by clicking on the Start Capture Thread button and press some keys. 
		Play around with the plug-ins dialog features to get an understanding of 
		what the plug-in can do.<br />
		Click on the Stop Capture Thread button and Close the plug-ins UI 
		dialog.<br />
		We can also construct a new plug-in object from this plug-ins script 
		class, lets try this:<br />
		<br />
		Open the file BrainStimPluginScriptBindings.qs?found in the directory 
		BrainStim\examples\GettingStartedGuide\BasicScripting\.<br />
		Examine the script quickly and then execute the QtScript code.<br />
		Repeat pressing a keyboard key (i.e. key '4') until the script finishes.<br />
		We saw that the key codes (a unique number for each key) of the captured 
		key presses where logged to the Output Log Pane and after having pressed 
		4 times the script automatically ended. The line var KeyBoardCaptureObj 
		= new KeyBoardCapture(); constructs a new object from the class defined 
		by the KeyBoardCapture plug-in. This object is then used by the script. 
		We now need to know what this plug-in object can do:<br />
		<br />
		Open the Help Contents by pressing the 'F1' key.<br />
		Enter 'KeyBoardCapture' in the help search field and press enter. A help 
		document with the name KeyBoard Device script class is found let's open 
		that by clicking on the link.<br />
		This help document is a script class reference, that shows all the 
		available signals/slots and member function that can be used inside the 
		script context for this plug-ins script class.</p>
		<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
		<h2>Help</h2>
		<p>You can always open the Help documentation by using the <kbd>F1</kbd> 
		key or the menu entry <kbd>Help</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Help Contents</kbd>. 
		This local help is completely offline available and you can use custom 
		keywords to search for a specific topic for which you need help. This 
		help contains the BrainStim help content including that of the
		<a href="../defaultplugins.html">default plugins</a>, furthermore if you 
		installed some additional 3rd party plugins than this documentation (if 
		provided by the plugin) is also available here.There's also an online 
		version of this Help, use
		<a href="http://svengijsen.github.io/BrainStim/" target="_blank">this 
		link</a> to open the online Help collection. This online collection only 
		contains the documentation for the latest release of BrainStim and it's
		<a href="../defaultplugins.html">default plugins</a>, 3rd party plugins 
		can provide thier own online documentation somewhere else. By using the 
		menu entry <kbd>Help</kbd> &gt; <kbd>About BrainStim</kbd> you can open 
		a dialog that shows the current version and licensing information for 
		the currently installed version. BrainStim is build making use of the
		<a href="https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/" target="_blank">Open 
		Source Qt libraries</a>, to view information regarding the used Qt 
		versions and licenses you can use the menu entry <kbd>Help</kbd> &gt; 
		<kbd>About Qt</kbd>.</p>
